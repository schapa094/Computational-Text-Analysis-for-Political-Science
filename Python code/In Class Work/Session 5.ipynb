Die CDU/CSU-Politiker hatten von Merkel wiederholt gefordert, den Migranten-Zustrom zu begrenzen. Doch die Kanzlerin hat sich bislang geweigert, eine Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge festzulegen, was die Grenzschließung für neu ankommende Migranten bedeuten würde.\"',\n",

Nun konkretisiert sie ihre Vorstellungen: Viel weniger Menschen als heute sollen auf Grundsicherung angewiesen sein – es sei immer günstiger, Arbeit anstatt Arbeitslosigkeit zu finanzieren.>>>Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: EXKLUSIV: „Mein Schmerzpunkt“ – Ex-Partei-Chef übt Kritik an Politik der Grünen<<<                        ©                    AFP 2018/ DPA/ Arne Dedert„So verhindert Politik bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen“: Ex-Grünen-Chef – EXKLUSIVVor allem die Zahl von zwei Millionen Kindern, die in Hartz-IV-Haushalten lebten, müsse verringert werden. „Diese Erfahrung, ein ‚Hartz-IV-Kind‘ zu sein, prägt fürs Leben. Wir brauchen daher eine eigenständige Kindergrundsicherung, die Kinder aus der Sozialhilfe holt und Teilhabe schafft“, zitieren Nahles deutsche Medien.Ein besseres Wohngeld könne zudem verhindern, „dass Menschen angesichts explodierender Mieten in\\xa0die Grundsicherung getrieben werden“. Nahles kritisierte außerdem das in\\xa0der SPD-Kanzlerschaft vom Altkanzler Gerhard Schröder eingeführte System der Zusammenlegung von Arbeitslosen- und Sozialhilfe und forderte weniger Bürokratie und Härte.>>>Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: Schon wieder Bulgarien – Illegale Migration durch tausendfachen Verkauf von EU-Pässen<<<                        ©                    AP Photo/ Martin Meissner„Wir werden Hartz IV hinter uns lassen“: Nahles verspricht Komplettumbau des Sozialstaates„Zum Symbol für das Misstrauen des Staates gegenüber den Grundsicherungsbeziehern sind die Sanktionen geworden.

Die Flüchtlingskonvention in\\xa0ihrer jetzigen Form entspreche nicht der heutigen globalisierten Welt.Die Konvention definiert den Begriff „Flüchtling“ und die Grundlagen, die für einen Asylantrag erforderlich sind. Einige Rechte, die Flüchtlinge genießen, gleichen denen der Bürger des Aufnahmestaates, andere – denen der Ausländer.                        ©                    REUTERS/ Michaela RehleDänemark besteht auf Konfiskationen: Flüchtlinge sollen Aufenthalt selber bezahlenAls die UN-Flüchtlingskonvention 1951 angenommen wurde, war Dänemark das erste Land, das sie unterzeichnet hat. Nun sei der Ministerpräsident der Auffassung, die von der Konvention auferlegten Verpflichtungen seien eine untragbare Bürde für Dänemark, schreibt die schwedische Zeitung Svenska Dagbladet.Eines der Probleme besteht laut Rasmussen darin, dass verschiedene Gruppen der Flüchtlinge verschiedene Regeln einhalten müssen. So gelten die verschärften Bedingungen für einen Familiennachzug nicht für alle. Die Fristen hängen davon ab, unter welchen Bedingungen das Asyl gewährt wurde.Die von Dänemark getroffenen Maßnahmen für die Reduzierung des Flüchtlingszustroms wirkten „inspirierend“ auf andere Staaten, so der dänische Ministerpräsident. Allerdings dürfe das Asylrecht als solches nicht abgeschafft werden. Dänemark habe nicht vor, alleine die Konvention außer Kraft zu setzen, Dänemark wolle gemeinsam mit anderen Staaten das System von innen verändern, erklärte Rasmussen. Eine der Forderungen könne sein, dass Flüchtlinge in\\xa0dem Land Asyl beantragen müssten, in\\xa0dem sie als erstes angekommen seien.                        ©                    AFP 2018/ Bulent KilicDänemark: Flüchtlinge mit mehr als 400 Euro werden zur Kasse gebetenMit Blick vor allem auf die syrischen Flüchtlinge fragte Ramussen: \\\\\"Wenn jemand, der Schutz vor Krieg sucht, zwei oder drei Jahre in\\xa0der Türkei gelebt hat, sollte er dann nach Europa gehen und dort Asyl beantragen?\\\\\" Die geltenden Regeln würden dies ermöglichen. \\\\\"Aber wir werden darüber eine Diskussion führen\\\\\", sagte er in\\xa0dem Fernsehinterview. In der Türkei leben nach Angaben Ankaras etwa zwei Millionen syrische Bürgerkriegsflüchtlinge.Das Wichtigste ist aus der Sicht des dänischen Politikers die Verständigung innerhalb Europas zu gewährleisten und eine einheitliche Sichtweise zu erarbeiten.„Dänemark kann nicht allein handeln, die anderen müssen auch teilnehmen. Ich kann doch ohne Zustimmung der anderen EU-Staaten das Ausweisungssystem nicht beschließen“, sagte Rasmussen.Diskussion\"',\n",

Damit begründete er unter anderem den Rückzug Österreichs aus dem globalen Migrationspakt der Vereinten Nationen, der nun verabschiedet wurde. Hatte der österreichische Vizekanzler auch wirklich Recht? Zum 70. Jahrestag der UN-Menschenrechte klärt Sputnik auf.Am Montag feiert die Welt ein wichtiges Jubiläum. Die Menschenrechte werden 70 Jahre alt. Am 10. Dezember 1948 einigten sich die Mitglieder der Vereinten Nationen auf die „Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte“ (AEMR). Heute beziehen sich die meisten demokratischen Staaten auf dieses Dokument.Auch ein anderes Abkommen erblickte am Montag das Licht der Welt. Der sogenannte „Globale Pakt für eine sichere, geordnete und reguläre Migration“. Genau wie bei der Menschenrechtserklärung handelt es sich auch beim UN-Migrationspakt um eine\\xa0 „unverbindliche Vereinbarung“ der Vereinten Nationen. In Marrakesch haben am Montag 164 Staaten den umstrittenen Migrationspakt, an dem 192 Staaten beteiligt waren, offiziell verabschiedet. Die USA nahmen an den Verhandlungen gar nicht erst teil. Mehrere Regierungen lehnten das Papier in\\xa0den letzten Wochen ab. Darunter befinden sich Ungarn, Polen, Tschechien, Bulgarien, Australien, die Slowakei, Israel und Österreich.>>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Uno nimmt umstrittenen Migrationspakt an<<<FPÖ-Vize: „Migration ist kein Menschenrecht“Die österreichische Begründung für den Rückzug lautete unter anderem: „Migration ist und darf auch kein Menschenrecht werden“, sagte Vizekanzler Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ).                        ©                    AP Photo/ Olmo Calvo„Ein zynisches Spiel“ – Warum der Migrationspakt keine Lösung istDer Aussage stimmt auch Geschäftsmann und ÖVP-Mitglied, Freiherr Norbert van Handel, zu. Migration sei „natürlich“ kein Menschenrecht. „Wir haben eine ganz genaue Definition von Menschenrechten. Freie Meinung, Zugang zum ordentlichen Gericht.“ Auch Reisefreiheit sei zwar ein Menschenrecht, aber eine Reisefreiheit mit dem Ziel, sich in\\xa0einem Land auf Dauer niederzulassen, sei definitiv kein Menschenrecht, erklärte van Handel gegenüber Sputnik.Ob das auch so stimmt, wollte die Sputnik-Redaktion überprüfen. Als Migration versteht man zunächst allgemein eine „Abwanderung in\\xa0ein anderes Land, in\\xa0eine andere Gegend, an einen anderen Ort“, so die „Bedeutungsübersicht“ des Dudens. Damit stellt per Definition auch eine Flucht aus dem eigenen Land aus jedweden Gründen zunächst eine Migration dar.Asyl als MenschenrechtDie Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte besteht aus 30 Artikeln. Zwei davon beschäftigen sich direkt mit dem Begriff Migration. So der Artikel 13, der auf die Auswanderungsfreiheit eingeht. Dort heißt es dazu: „Jeder hat das Recht, jedes Land, einschließlich seines eigenen, zu verlassen und in\\xa0sein Land zurückzukehren.“Im Artikel 14, der das Menschenrecht auf Asyl beschreibt, heißt es: „Jeder hat das Recht, in\\xa0anderen Ländern vor Verfolgung Asyl zu suchen und zu genießen.“ Im Falle einer Strafverfolgung, „die tatsächlich auf Grund von Verbrechen nichtpolitischer Art oder auf Grund von Handlungen erfolgt, die gegen die Ziele und Grundsätze der Vereinten Nationen verstoßen“, könne jedoch dieses Recht nicht in\\xa0Anspruch genommen werden.So werde Migration zu einem Menschenrecht, spätestens wenn Menschenleben durch äußere Faktoren wie Krieg und andere Katastrophen in\\xa0Gefahr seien, bestätigt der Politikwissenschaftler von der Universität Wien, Prof. Dr. Otmar Höll, im Sputnik-Interview. „Wir haben die Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention, wir haben den Menschenrechtspakt, die in\\xa0diese Richtung weisen. Und tatsächlich sind sie völlig außer Streit zu stellen“, findet Höll.\\xa0 Er bemerkt zudem, dass Österreich seit einigen Monaten im UN-Menschenrechtsbeirat sitzt. Daher würden Straches Äußerungen und der Rückzug aus dem UN-Migrationspakt einen „Bruch mit der guten österreichischen Tradition“ bedeuten.Jedoch bezweifelt der Politologe, dass Migration zu einem Menschenrecht im völkerrechtlichen Sinn in\\xa0naher Zukunft werde könne. „Aber die Migration als solche wird man mit einer derartigen Ablehnung nicht anhalten können“, warnt Professor Höll.>>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Nachzug von Flüchtlingen in\\xa0Deutschland: Zahl der Visa weit unter Obergrenze<<<Flucht gleich Migration?Flüchtlinge würden nicht zu Migration gehören, behauptet gegenüber Sputnik der UNHCR-Pressereferent Martin Rentsch: „Per Definition fliehen sie vor Krieg, Folter und Menschenrechtsverletzungen. Das unterscheidet sie von Migranten.“                        ©                    AP Photo/ Emrah GurelAlleine alle Flüchtlinge in EU aufnehmen? – Berlin und Paris haben AngstDer Migrationsforscher von der Technischen Universität Dresden, Dr. Oliviero Angeli,\\xa0 definiert Flucht als „eine Form der Migration, aber nicht die einzige Form von Migration“. Es könne auch darüber diskutiert werden, wer unter dem Begriff Flüchtlinge allgemein verstanden werden kann, bemerkt Angeli. Die deutsche Regierung poche dabei sehr stark auf die Definition der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention. Danach gilt als Flüchtling eine Person, die „aus der begründeten Furcht vor Verfolgung wegen ihrer Rasse, Religion, Nationalität, Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten sozialen Gruppe oder wegen ihrer politischen Überzeugung sich außerhalb des Landes befindet, dessen Staatsangehörigkeit sie besitzt“.„Kein Recht, in\\xa0andere Länder einzuwandern“Die Frage nach der menschenrechtlichen Basis der Migration\\xa0 ist für Angeli „auf legaler Ebene relativ klar“: „Wir haben Rechte, uns innerhalb der Staaten frei zu bewegen oder aus den Staaten auszuwandern. Aber wir haben bis dato kein Recht, in\\xa0andere Länder einzuwandern. Aus moralischer Sicht kann man für dieses Recht eintreten, aber politisch ist es mittel- bis langfristig schwer umsetzbar“, erklärt der Migrationsforscher. Dass die UN-Menschenrechte bis heute keine rechtlich verbindliche Basis besitzen, schwäche die Position derjenigen, die sich für ein Recht auf Bewegungsfreiheit oder für ein Recht auf Einwanderung stark machen, betont Angeli. Dieses Recht müsse man erst in\\xa0der Menschenrechtskonvention stärker etablieren. „Doch dafür ist der politische Wille momentan nicht vorhanden“, so der Politikwissenschaftler Dr. Oliviero Angeli.Der „Globale Pakt für Migration“ wurde am Montag beim UN-Gipfeltreffen in\\xa0Marokko unterzeichnet. Das 34 Seiten umfassende Dokument soll dazu beitragen, Flucht und Migration besser zu organisieren.Das komplette Interview mit Dr. Oliviero Angeli zum Nachhören:Das komplette Interview mit Prof. Dr. Otmar Höll zum Nachhören:Diskussion\"',\n",

Sie bringen Kriminalität und es gibt viele Probleme.“ Kalifornien sei in\\xa0vieler Hinsicht „außer Kontrolle geraten“, ist der US-Staatschef überzeugt. „Offenbar stimmen mir die Wähler zu, sonst hätten sie nicht für mich gestimmt.“  Wie WP unter Verweis auf die US-Bundespolizei FBI schreibt, ist die Kriminalität in\\xa0sogenannten „Asyl-Städten“ angeblich sogar niedriger als in\\xa0anderen Ortschaften. Was ist eine „Asyl-Stadt“? In den USA gibt es derzeit laut WP etwa 60 Städte mit speziellen Asyl-Gesetzen („Asyl-Städte“ bzw. „Sanctuary Cities“), darunter Los Angeles und New York. Die Gesetzeslage variiert von Stadt zu Stadt, doch im Allgemeinen beschützt sie illegale Einwanderer, die gewaltlose Verbrechen begangen haben, davor, von den Lokalregierungen an die Bundesbehörden übergeben zu werden. Das Verüben von Kavaliersdelikten durch Migranten führt demnach nicht zwingend zu bundesstaatlichem Gewahrsam. Stadtmitarbeiter und Strafverfolgungsbehörden einer sogenannten Asyl-Stadt dürfen zudem nicht nach dem Einwanderungsstatus eines Strafverdächtigen fragen. Gegner der Verordnung argumentieren, dass diese kriminelle Zuwanderer vor der Abschiebung bewahre.\"',\n",

Die Idee, Kinder für das Verhalten ihrer Eltern zu bestrafen und diese durch die Misshandlung der Kinder abzuschrecken, sei skrupellos.Der UN-Hochkommissar für Menschenrechte, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, hat in\\xa0Genf die USA scharf angegriffen. Bezugnehmend auf die jüngst forcierte Praxis, an der mexikanisch-US-amerikanischen Grenze festgenommene illegale Einwanderer von ihren Kindern zu trennen, sprach Al Hussein von einer „grausamen Praxis“, die „irreparable Schäden mit lebenslangen Folgen“ nach sich ziehen könnte.\\xa0 Wörtlich sagte der Hochkommissar an die Adresse der US-Regierung: „Die Idee, dass ein Staat versucht, Eltern dadurch abzuschrecken, indem Kindern eine solche Misshandlung zugefügt wird, ist skrupellos.“>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Trump: „Menschen in\\xa0Deutschland wenden sich gegen ihre Regierung“Die im Video dokumentierte Passage der Erklärung von Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein im Wortlaut:„In the United States, I am deeply concerned by\\xa0recently adopted policies which punish children for\\xa0that parent’s actions. In the past\\xa0six weeks, nearly 2,000 children have been forcibly separated from\\xa0their parents. The American Association of\\xa0Pediatrics [APP] has called this cruel practice \\'government-sanctioned child abuse\\' which may cause \\'irreparable harm\\' with \\'lifelong consequences\\'. The thought that any state would seek to\\xa0deter parents by\\xa0inflicting such abuse on\\xa0children is unconscionable. I call on\\xa0the United States to\\xa0immediately end the practice of\\xa0forcible separation of\\xa0these children, and I encourage the government to\\xa0at last ratify the [UN] Convention on\\xa0the Rights of\\xa0the Child, in\\xa0order to\\xa0ensure that the fundamental rights of\\xa0all children, whatever their administrative status, will be at\\xa0the centre of\\xa0all domestic laws and policies.”                        ©                    REUTERS/ Jorge Duenes„Migranten-Karawane“ trifft an Mexikos Grenze zu USA ein – VIDEO“Ich bin zutiefst besorgt über die aktuell in\\xa0den Vereinigten Staaten angewandte Praxis, Kinder für Handlungen ihrer Eltern zu bestrafen. In den vergangenen sechs Wochen wurden beinahe 2.000 Kinder gewaltsam von ihren Eltern getrennt. Die Amerikanische Vereinigung für Kinderheilkunde (APP) nennt diese grausame Praxis „staatlich sanktionierte Kindesmisshandlung, die irreparable Schäden mit lebenslangen Folgen hervorrufen könne“. Die Idee, dass ein Staat versucht, Eltern dadurch abzuschrecken, indem Kindern eine solche Misshandlung zugefügt wird, ist skrupellos. Ich rufe die Vereinigten Staaten auf, unverzüglich die Praxis der gewaltsamen Trennung dieser Kinder zu beenden, und ich ermutige die Regierung, endlich die UN-Konvention für die Rechte der Kinder zu ratifizieren, um sicherzustellen, dass die fundamentalen Rechte aller Kinder, gleich welchen administrativen Status, im Zentrum aller öffentlichen Gesetze und Politik stehen.“>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Trump will Migranten „von überall her“Diskussion\"',\n",

Am vergangenen Mittwoch hat das Europäische Parlament dem Antrag auf ein Strafverfahren gegen Ungarn wegen Verstößen gegen europäische Normen und Prinzipien der Rechtshoheit zugestimmt. Das Europaparlament behandelt erstmals ein Dokument, in\\xa0dem es um die Anwendung von Artikel 7 des EU-Vertrages gegen Ungarn geht. >>>Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: „Dafür würde ich aus dem Amt gejagt“ – Orban zu Merkels Flüchtlingspolitik  „Sie (die EU – Anm. d.

In Brüssel werden die ungarischen Behörden vor allem für die Weigerung kritisiert, die Entscheidungen der Europäischen Union im Bereich Migrationspolitik zu erfüllen. Mitte Juli hatte die Europäische Kommission beim Europäischen Gerichtshof bereits eine Beschwerde gegen Ungarn eingereicht, da es die EU-Vorschriften zur Asylgewährung für Flüchtlinge nicht befolgt hatte. >>>Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: EU-Kommission reicht beim Europäischen Gerichtshof Klage gegen Ungarn ein\"',\n",
