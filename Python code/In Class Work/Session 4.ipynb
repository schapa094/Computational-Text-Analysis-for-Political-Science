       "'I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\\n\\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\\n\\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we\\'ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\\n\\nIn a sense we\\'ve come to our nation\\'s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"\\n\\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we\\'ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\\n\\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God\\'s children.\\n\\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro\\'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\\n\\nBut there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\\n\\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.\\n\\nWe cannot walk alone.\\n\\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.\\n\\nWe cannot turn back.\\n\\nThere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. **We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro\\'s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\"** We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"1\\n\\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.\\n\\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.\\n\\nAnd so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\\n\\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"\\n\\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\\n\\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\\n\\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\\n\\nI have a dream today!\\n\\nI have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\\n\\nI have a dream today!\\n\\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\"2\\n\\nThis is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.\\n\\nWith this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\\n\\nAnd this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God\\'s children will be able to sing with new meaning:\\n\\nMy country \\'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim\\'s pride,    From every mountainside, let freedom ring!\\n\\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.\\n\\nAnd so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\\n\\nBut not only that:\\n\\nLet freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.\\n\\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring\\n\\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\\'s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:\\n\\nFree at last! Free at last!\\n\\nThank God Almighty, we are free at last!3'"

Nun konkretisiert sie ihre Vorstellungen: Viel weniger Menschen als heute sollen auf Grundsicherung angewiesen sein – es sei immer günstiger, Arbeit anstatt Arbeitslosigkeit zu finanzieren.>>>Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: EXKLUSIV: „Mein Schmerzpunkt“ – Ex-Partei-Chef übt Kritik an Politik der Grünen<<<                        ©                    AFP 2018/ DPA/ Arne Dedert„So verhindert Politik bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen“: Ex-Grünen-Chef – EXKLUSIVVor allem die Zahl von zwei Millionen Kindern, die in Hartz-IV-Haushalten lebten, müsse verringert werden. „Diese Erfahrung, ein ‚Hartz-IV-Kind‘ zu sein, prägt fürs Leben. Wir brauchen daher eine eigenständige Kindergrundsicherung, die Kinder aus der Sozialhilfe holt und Teilhabe schafft“, zitieren Nahles deutsche Medien.Ein besseres Wohngeld könne zudem verhindern, „dass Menschen angesichts explodierender Mieten in die Grundsicherung getrieben werden“. Nahles kritisierte außerdem das in der SPD-Kanzlerschaft vom Altkanzler Gerhard Schröder eingeführte System der Zusammenlegung von Arbeitslosen- und Sozialhilfe und forderte weniger Bürokratie und Härte.>>>Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: Schon wieder Bulgarien – Illegale Migration durch tausendfachen Verkauf von EU-Pässen<<<                        ©                    AP Photo/ Martin Meissner„Wir werden Hartz IV hinter uns lassen“: Nahles verspricht Komplettumbau des Sozialstaates„Zum Symbol für das Misstrauen des Staates gegenüber den Grundsicherungsbeziehern sind die Sanktionen geworden.

Das teilte der Staatschef vor der Presse mit.Wie Trump vor Journalisten sagte, hat er „gerade“ ein entsprechendes Dekret unterzeichnet. Demnach sollen nur noch Menschen Asyl beantragen können, die an einem offiziellen Grenzübergang in die USA einreisen. Illegal Eingereiste würden kein Asyl beantragen dürfen.>>> Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: Trump erklärt, warum USA Migranten brauchen                        ©                    REUTERS/ Leah MillisTrump droht mit Schließung der Grenze zu MexikoDie Verweigerung des Rechts auf einen Asylantrag für illegale Migranten sei zeitweilig und betreffe die Ausländer, die die südliche US-Grenze zu Mexiko gesetzwidrig überschreiten würden, geht aus Trumps Proklamation hervor.„Ich treffe befristete Maßnahmen zum Einreisestopp für Ausländer, um das Problem der großen Anzahl von Migranten zu lösen, die über Mexiko kommen, um in unser Land ohne richtige Dokumente einzureisen“.>>> Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: Bundestag beschließt Verschärfung des Asylgesetzes                        ©                    AFP 2018/ GERARD JULIENMauer reloaded: EU-Staaten errichten sechs neue „Berliner Mauern“Ein Einwanderer könne dennoch Asyl beantragen, wenn er sich an die US-Grenzbehörden wende, statt zu versuchen, in die USA illegal zu gelangen.Laut Trump haben die ankommenden Migranten in der Regel keine legalen Gründe, Asyl zu beantragen. Die Ankunft von einer großen Anzahl von Ausländern werde das US-Immigrationssystem überlasten und zur „Freilassung\\\" von Tausenden Ausländern innerhalb der USA“ führen.Zuvor hatte das US-Verteidigungsministerium seine Bereitschaft erklärt, bis zu 7000 Militärangehörige an der Grenze zwischen den USA und Mexiko zu stationieren. Trump verkündete, bis zu 15.000 Soldaten an die Grenze zu schicken, wo sich bereits 2100 Mitglieder der Nationalgarde der Vereinigten Staaten befinden.>>> Weitere Sputnik-Artikel: „Kein Menschenrecht auf Migration“: Österreich verlässt UN-Migrationspakt                        ©                    REUTERS/ Carlos Garcia RawlinsMigranten vs. US-Armee: Wer sind die Drahtzieher der Flüchtlingskarawane?Die Maßnahmen werden getroffen, weil eine Karawane mit Tausenden Menschen aus zentralamerikanischen Ländern sich den USA über das Territorium von Mexiko nähert. Weitere zwei Migrantengruppen bewegen sich aus Salvador in Richtung USA.Nach Informationen der Nachrichtenagentur France-Presse bezeichnete die Bürgerrechtsorganisation American Civil Liberties Union die Pläne für eine Verschärfung des Asylrechts am Donnerstag als „illegal“. Das US-Recht erlaube Menschen einen Asylantrag unabhängig davon zu stellen, ob sie sich an einem Grenzübergang befinden oder nicht.

Die Ankunft von einer großen Anzahl von Ausländern werde das US-Immigrationssystem überlasten und zur „Freilassung\\\\\" von Tausenden Ausländern innerhalb der USA“ führen.Zuvor hatte das US-Verteidigungsministerium seine Bereitschaft erklärt, bis zu 7000 Militärangehörige an der Grenze zwischen den USA und Mexiko zu stationieren.

Die Flüchtlingskonvention in\\xa0ihrer jetzigen Form entspreche nicht der heutigen globalisierten Welt.Die Konvention definiert den Begriff „Flüchtling“ und die Grundlagen, die für einen Asylantrag erforderlich sind. Einige Rechte, die Flüchtlinge genießen, gleichen denen der Bürger des Aufnahmestaates, andere – denen der Ausländer.                        ©                    REUTERS/ Michaela RehleDänemark besteht auf Konfiskationen: Flüchtlinge sollen Aufenthalt selber bezahlenAls die UN-Flüchtlingskonvention 1951 angenommen wurde, war Dänemark das erste Land, das sie unterzeichnet hat. Nun sei der Ministerpräsident der Auffassung, die von der Konvention auferlegten Verpflichtungen seien eine untragbare Bürde für Dänemark, schreibt die schwedische Zeitung Svenska Dagbladet.Eines der Probleme besteht laut Rasmussen darin, dass verschiedene Gruppen der Flüchtlinge verschiedene Regeln einhalten müssen. So gelten die verschärften Bedingungen für einen Familiennachzug nicht für alle. Die Fristen hängen davon ab, unter welchen Bedingungen das Asyl gewährt wurde.Die von Dänemark getroffenen Maßnahmen für die Reduzierung des Flüchtlingszustroms wirkten „inspirierend“ auf andere Staaten, so der dänische Ministerpräsident. Allerdings dürfe das Asylrecht als solches nicht abgeschafft werden. Dänemark habe nicht vor, alleine die Konvention außer Kraft zu setzen, Dänemark wolle gemeinsam mit anderen Staaten das System von innen verändern, erklärte Rasmussen. Eine der Forderungen könne sein, dass Flüchtlinge in\\xa0dem Land Asyl beantragen müssten, in\\xa0dem sie als erstes angekommen seien.                        ©                    AFP 2018/ Bulent KilicDänemark: Flüchtlinge mit mehr als 400 Euro werden zur Kasse gebetenMit Blick vor allem auf die syrischen Flüchtlinge fragte Ramussen: \\\\\"Wenn jemand, der Schutz vor Krieg sucht, zwei oder drei Jahre in\\xa0der Türkei gelebt hat, sollte er dann nach Europa gehen und dort Asyl beantragen?\\\\\" Die geltenden Regeln würden dies ermöglichen. \\\\\"Aber wir werden darüber eine Diskussion führen\\\\\", sagte er in\\xa0dem Fernsehinterview.

Damit begründete er unter anderem den Rückzug Österreichs aus dem globalen Migrationspakt der Vereinten Nationen, der nun verabschiedet wurde. Hatte der österreichische Vizekanzler auch wirklich Recht? Zum 70. Jahrestag der UN-Menschenrechte klärt Sputnik auf.Am Montag feiert die Welt ein wichtiges Jubiläum. Die Menschenrechte werden 70 Jahre alt. Am 10. Dezember 1948 einigten sich die Mitglieder der Vereinten Nationen auf die „Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte“ (AEMR). Heute beziehen sich die meisten demokratischen Staaten auf dieses Dokument.Auch ein anderes Abkommen erblickte am Montag das Licht der Welt. Der sogenannte „Globale Pakt für eine sichere, geordnete und reguläre Migration“. Genau wie bei der Menschenrechtserklärung handelt es sich auch beim UN-Migrationspakt um eine\\xa0 „unverbindliche Vereinbarung“ der Vereinten Nationen. In Marrakesch haben am Montag 164 Staaten den umstrittenen Migrationspakt, an dem 192 Staaten beteiligt waren, offiziell verabschiedet. Die USA nahmen an den Verhandlungen gar nicht erst teil. Mehrere Regierungen lehnten das Papier in\\xa0den letzten Wochen ab. Darunter befinden sich Ungarn, Polen, Tschechien, Bulgarien, Australien, die Slowakei, Israel und Österreich.>>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Uno nimmt umstrittenen Migrationspakt an<<<FPÖ-Vize: „Migration ist kein Menschenrecht“Die österreichische Begründung für den Rückzug lautete unter anderem: „Migration ist und darf auch kein Menschenrecht werden“, sagte Vizekanzler Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ).                        ©                    AP Photo/ Olmo Calvo„Ein zynisches Spiel“ – Warum der Migrationspakt keine Lösung istDer Aussage stimmt auch Geschäftsmann und ÖVP-Mitglied, Freiherr Norbert van Handel, zu. Migration sei „natürlich“ kein Menschenrecht. „Wir haben eine ganz genaue Definition von Menschenrechten. Freie Meinung, Zugang zum ordentlichen Gericht.“ Auch Reisefreiheit sei zwar ein Menschenrecht, aber eine Reisefreiheit mit dem Ziel, sich in\\xa0einem Land auf Dauer niederzulassen, sei definitiv kein Menschenrecht, erklärte van Handel gegenüber Sputnik.Ob das auch so stimmt, wollte die Sputnik-Redaktion überprüfen. Als Migration versteht man zunächst allgemein eine „Abwanderung in\\xa0ein anderes Land, in\\xa0eine andere Gegend, an einen anderen Ort“, so die „Bedeutungsübersicht“ des Dudens. Damit stellt per Definition auch eine Flucht aus dem eigenen Land aus jedweden Gründen zunächst eine Migration dar.Asyl als MenschenrechtDie Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte besteht aus 30 Artikeln. Zwei davon beschäftigen sich direkt mit dem Begriff Migration. So der Artikel 13, der auf die Auswanderungsfreiheit eingeht. Dort heißt es dazu: „Jeder hat das Recht, jedes Land, einschließlich seines eigenen, zu verlassen und in\\xa0sein Land zurückzukehren.“Im Artikel 14, der das Menschenrecht auf Asyl beschreibt, heißt es: „Jeder hat das Recht, in\\xa0anderen Ländern vor Verfolgung Asyl zu suchen und zu genießen.“ Im Falle einer Strafverfolgung, „die tatsächlich auf Grund von Verbrechen nichtpolitischer Art oder auf Grund von Handlungen erfolgt, die gegen die Ziele und Grundsätze der Vereinten Nationen verstoßen“, könne jedoch dieses Recht nicht in\\xa0Anspruch genommen werden.So werde Migration zu einem Menschenrecht, spätestens wenn Menschenleben durch äußere Faktoren wie Krieg und andere Katastrophen in\\xa0Gefahr seien, bestätigt der Politikwissenschaftler von der Universität Wien, Prof. Dr. Otmar Höll, im Sputnik-Interview. „Wir haben die Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention, wir haben den Menschenrechtspakt, die in\\xa0diese Richtung weisen. Und tatsächlich sind sie völlig außer Streit zu stellen“, findet Höll.\\xa0 Er bemerkt zudem, dass Österreich seit einigen Monaten im UN-Menschenrechtsbeirat sitzt. Daher würden Straches Äußerungen und der Rückzug aus dem UN-Migrationspakt einen „Bruch mit der guten österreichischen Tradition“ bedeuten.Jedoch bezweifelt der Politologe, dass Migration zu einem Menschenrecht im völkerrechtlichen Sinn in\\xa0naher Zukunft werde könne. „Aber die Migration als solche wird man mit einer derartigen Ablehnung nicht anhalten können“, warnt Professor Höll.>>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Nachzug von Flüchtlingen in\\xa0Deutschland: Zahl der Visa weit unter Obergrenze<<<Flucht gleich Migration?Flüchtlinge würden nicht zu Migration gehören, behauptet gegenüber Sputnik der UNHCR-Pressereferent Martin Rentsch: „Per Definition fliehen sie vor Krieg, Folter und Menschenrechtsverletzungen. Das unterscheidet sie von Migranten.“                        ©                    AP Photo/ Emrah GurelAlleine alle Flüchtlinge in EU aufnehmen? – Berlin und Paris haben AngstDer Migrationsforscher von der Technischen Universität Dresden, Dr. Oliviero Angeli,\\xa0 definiert Flucht als „eine Form der Migration, aber nicht die einzige Form von Migration“. Es könne auch darüber diskutiert werden, wer unter dem Begriff Flüchtlinge allgemein verstanden werden kann, bemerkt Angeli. Die deutsche Regierung poche dabei sehr stark auf die Definition der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention. Danach gilt als Flüchtling eine Person, die „aus der begründeten Furcht vor Verfolgung wegen ihrer Rasse, Religion, Nationalität, Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten sozialen Gruppe oder wegen ihrer politischen Überzeugung sich außerhalb des Landes befindet, dessen Staatsangehörigkeit sie besitzt“.„Kein Recht, in\\xa0andere Länder einzuwandern“Die Frage nach der menschenrechtlichen Basis der Migration\\xa0 ist für Angeli „auf legaler Ebene relativ klar“: „Wir haben Rechte, uns innerhalb der Staaten frei zu bewegen oder aus den Staaten auszuwandern. Aber wir haben bis dato kein Recht, in\\xa0andere Länder einzuwandern. Aus moralischer Sicht kann man für dieses Recht eintreten, aber politisch ist es mittel- bis langfristig schwer umsetzbar“, erklärt der Migrationsforscher. Dass die UN-Menschenrechte bis heute keine rechtlich verbindliche Basis besitzen, schwäche die Position derjenigen, die sich für ein Recht auf Bewegungsfreiheit oder für ein Recht auf Einwanderung stark machen, betont Angeli. Dieses Recht müsse man erst in\\xa0der Menschenrechtskonvention stärker etablieren. „Doch dafür ist der politische Wille momentan nicht vorhanden“, so der Politikwissenschaftler Dr. Oliviero Angeli.Der „Globale Pakt für Migration“ wurde am Montag beim UN-Gipfeltreffen in\\xa0Marokko unterzeichnet. Das 34 Seiten umfassende Dokument soll dazu beitragen, Flucht und Migration besser zu organisieren.Das komplette Interview mit Dr. Oliviero Angeli zum Nachhören:Das komplette Interview mit Prof. Dr. Otmar Höll zum Nachhören:Diskussion\"', 'OVER-THRESHOLD', 'flüchtlingen asyl einwanderung flucht flüchtlinge flüchtling migration', '1461', '0.537197634217539']\n",

Die Flüchtlingskonvention in\\xa0ihrer jetzigen Form entspreche nicht der heutigen globalisierten Welt.Die Konvention definiert den Begriff „Flüchtling“ und die Grundlagen, die für einen Asylantrag erforderlich sind. Einige Rechte, die Flüchtlinge genießen, gleichen denen der Bürger des Aufnahmestaates, andere – denen der Ausländer.                        ©                    REUTERS/ Michaela RehleDänemark besteht auf Konfiskationen: Flüchtlinge sollen Aufenthalt selber bezahlenAls die UN-Flüchtlingskonvention 1951 angenommen wurde, war Dänemark das erste Land, das sie unterzeichnet hat. Nun sei der Ministerpräsident der Auffassung, die von der Konvention auferlegten Verpflichtungen seien eine untragbare Bürde für Dänemark, schreibt die schwedische Zeitung Svenska Dagbladet.Eines der Probleme besteht laut Rasmussen darin, dass verschiedene Gruppen der Flüchtlinge verschiedene Regeln einhalten müssen. So gelten die verschärften Bedingungen für einen Familiennachzug nicht für alle. Die Fristen hängen davon ab, unter welchen Bedingungen das Asyl gewährt wurde.Die von Dänemark getroffenen Maßnahmen für die Reduzierung des Flüchtlingszustroms wirkten „inspirierend“ auf andere Staaten, so der dänische Ministerpräsident. Allerdings dürfe das Asylrecht als solches nicht abgeschafft werden. Dänemark habe nicht vor, alleine die Konvention außer Kraft zu setzen, Dänemark wolle gemeinsam mit anderen Staaten das System von innen verändern, erklärte Rasmussen. Eine der Forderungen könne sein, dass Flüchtlinge in\\xa0dem Land Asyl beantragen müssten, in\\xa0dem sie als erstes angekommen seien.                        ©                    AFP 2018/ Bulent KilicDänemark: Flüchtlinge mit mehr als 400 Euro werden zur Kasse gebetenMit Blick vor allem auf die syrischen Flüchtlinge fragte Ramussen: \\\\\"Wenn jemand, der Schutz vor Krieg sucht, zwei oder drei Jahre in\\xa0der Türkei gelebt hat, sollte er dann nach Europa gehen und dort Asyl beantragen?\\\\\" Die geltenden Regeln würden dies ermöglichen. \\\\\"Aber wir werden darüber eine Diskussion führen\\\\\", sagte er in\\xa0dem Fernsehinterview. In der Türkei leben nach Angaben Ankaras etwa zwei Millionen syrische Bürgerkriegsflüchtlinge.Das Wichtigste ist aus der Sicht des dänischen Politikers die Verständigung innerhalb Europas zu gewährleisten und eine einheitliche Sichtweise zu erarbeiten.„Dänemark kann nicht allein handeln, die anderen müssen auch teilnehmen. Ich kann doch ohne Zustimmung der anderen EU-Staaten das Ausweisungssystem nicht beschließen“, sagte Rasmussen.Diskussion\"',\n",

Damit begründete er unter anderem den Rückzug Österreichs aus dem globalen Migrationspakt der Vereinten Nationen, der nun verabschiedet wurde. Hatte der österreichische Vizekanzler auch wirklich Recht? Zum 70. Jahrestag der UN-Menschenrechte klärt Sputnik auf.Am Montag feiert die Welt ein wichtiges Jubiläum. Die Menschenrechte werden 70 Jahre alt. Am 10. Dezember 1948 einigten sich die Mitglieder der Vereinten Nationen auf die „Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte“ (AEMR). Heute beziehen sich die meisten demokratischen Staaten auf dieses Dokument.Auch ein anderes Abkommen erblickte am Montag das Licht der Welt. Der sogenannte „Globale Pakt für eine sichere, geordnete und reguläre Migration“. Genau wie bei der Menschenrechtserklärung handelt es sich auch beim UN-Migrationspakt um eine\\xa0 „unverbindliche Vereinbarung“ der Vereinten Nationen. In Marrakesch haben am Montag 164 Staaten den umstrittenen Migrationspakt, an dem 192 Staaten beteiligt waren, offiziell verabschiedet. Die USA nahmen an den Verhandlungen gar nicht erst teil. Mehrere Regierungen lehnten das Papier in\\xa0den letzten Wochen ab. Darunter befinden sich Ungarn, Polen, Tschechien, Bulgarien, Australien, die Slowakei, Israel und Österreich.>>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Uno nimmt umstrittenen Migrationspakt an<<<FPÖ-Vize: „Migration ist kein Menschenrecht“Die österreichische Begründung für den Rückzug lautete unter anderem: „Migration ist und darf auch kein Menschenrecht werden“, sagte Vizekanzler Heinz-Christian Strache (FPÖ).                        ©                    AP Photo/ Olmo Calvo„Ein zynisches Spiel“ – Warum der Migrationspakt keine Lösung istDer Aussage stimmt auch Geschäftsmann und ÖVP-Mitglied, Freiherr Norbert van Handel, zu. Migration sei „natürlich“ kein Menschenrecht. „Wir haben eine ganz genaue Definition von Menschenrechten. Freie Meinung, Zugang zum ordentlichen Gericht.“ Auch Reisefreiheit sei zwar ein Menschenrecht, aber eine Reisefreiheit mit dem Ziel, sich in\\xa0einem Land auf Dauer niederzulassen, sei definitiv kein Menschenrecht, erklärte van Handel gegenüber Sputnik.Ob das auch so stimmt, wollte die Sputnik-Redaktion überprüfen. Als Migration versteht man zunächst allgemein eine „Abwanderung in\\xa0ein anderes Land, in\\xa0eine andere Gegend, an einen anderen Ort“, so die „Bedeutungsübersicht“ des Dudens. Damit stellt per Definition auch eine Flucht aus dem eigenen Land aus jedweden Gründen zunächst eine Migration dar.Asyl als MenschenrechtDie Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte besteht aus 30 Artikeln. Zwei davon beschäftigen sich direkt mit dem Begriff Migration. So der Artikel 13, der auf die Auswanderungsfreiheit eingeht. Dort heißt es dazu: „Jeder hat das Recht, jedes Land, einschließlich seines eigenen, zu verlassen und in\\xa0sein Land zurückzukehren.“Im Artikel 14, der das Menschenrecht auf Asyl beschreibt, heißt es: „Jeder hat das Recht, in\\xa0anderen Ländern vor Verfolgung Asyl zu suchen und zu genießen.“ Im Falle einer Strafverfolgung, „die tatsächlich auf Grund von Verbrechen nichtpolitischer Art oder auf Grund von Handlungen erfolgt, die gegen die Ziele und Grundsätze der Vereinten Nationen verstoßen“, könne jedoch dieses Recht nicht in\\xa0Anspruch genommen werden.So werde Migration zu einem Menschenrecht, spätestens wenn Menschenleben durch äußere Faktoren wie Krieg und andere Katastrophen in\\xa0Gefahr seien, bestätigt der Politikwissenschaftler von der Universität Wien, Prof. Dr. Otmar Höll, im Sputnik-Interview. „Wir haben die Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention, wir haben den Menschenrechtspakt, die in\\xa0diese Richtung weisen. Und tatsächlich sind sie völlig außer Streit zu stellen“, findet Höll.\\xa0 Er bemerkt zudem, dass Österreich seit einigen Monaten im UN-Menschenrechtsbeirat sitzt. Daher würden Straches Äußerungen und der Rückzug aus dem UN-Migrationspakt einen „Bruch mit der guten österreichischen Tradition“ bedeuten.Jedoch bezweifelt der Politologe, dass Migration zu einem Menschenrecht im völkerrechtlichen Sinn in\\xa0naher Zukunft werde könne. „Aber die Migration als solche wird man mit einer derartigen Ablehnung nicht anhalten können“, warnt Professor Höll.>>>Andere Sputnik-Artikel: Nachzug von Flüchtlingen in\\xa0Deutschland: Zahl der Visa weit unter Obergrenze<<<Flucht gleich Migration?Flüchtlinge würden nicht zu Migration gehören, behauptet gegenüber Sputnik der UNHCR-Pressereferent Martin Rentsch: „Per Definition fliehen sie vor Krieg, Folter und Menschenrechtsverletzungen. Das unterscheidet sie von Migranten.“                        ©                    AP Photo/ Emrah GurelAlleine alle Flüchtlinge in EU aufnehmen? – Berlin und Paris haben AngstDer Migrationsforscher von der Technischen Universität Dresden, Dr. Oliviero Angeli,\\xa0 definiert Flucht als „eine Form der Migration, aber nicht die einzige Form von Migration“. Es könne auch darüber diskutiert werden, wer unter dem Begriff Flüchtlinge allgemein verstanden werden kann, bemerkt Angeli. Die deutsche Regierung poche dabei sehr stark auf die Definition der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention. Danach gilt als Flüchtling eine Person, die „aus der begründeten Furcht vor Verfolgung wegen ihrer Rasse, Religion, Nationalität, Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten sozialen Gruppe oder wegen ihrer politischen Überzeugung sich außerhalb des Landes befindet, dessen Staatsangehörigkeit sie besitzt“.„Kein Recht, in\\xa0andere Länder einzuwandern“Die Frage nach der menschenrechtlichen Basis der Migration\\xa0 ist für Angeli „auf legaler Ebene relativ klar“: „Wir haben Rechte, uns innerhalb der Staaten frei zu bewegen oder aus den Staaten auszuwandern. Aber wir haben bis dato kein Recht, in\\xa0andere Länder einzuwandern. Aus moralischer Sicht kann man für dieses Recht eintreten, aber politisch ist es mittel- bis langfristig schwer umsetzbar“, erklärt der Migrationsforscher. Dass die UN-Menschenrechte bis heute keine rechtlich verbindliche Basis besitzen, schwäche die Position derjenigen, die sich für ein Recht auf Bewegungsfreiheit oder für ein Recht auf Einwanderung stark machen, betont Angeli. Dieses Recht müsse man erst in\\xa0der Menschenrechtskonvention stärker etablieren. „Doch dafür ist der politische Wille momentan nicht vorhanden“, so der Politikwissenschaftler Dr. Oliviero Angeli.Der „Globale Pakt für Migration“ wurde am Montag beim UN-Gipfeltreffen in\\xa0Marokko unterzeichnet. Das 34 Seiten umfassende Dokument soll dazu beitragen, Flucht und Migration besser zu organisieren.Das komplette Interview mit Dr. Oliviero Angeli zum Nachhören:Das komplette Interview mit Prof. Dr. Otmar Höll zum Nachhören:Diskussion\"',\n",

Was ist eine „Asyl-Stadt“? In den USA gibt es derzeit laut WP etwa 60 Städte mit speziellen Asyl-Gesetzen („Asyl-Städte“ bzw. „Sanctuary Cities“), darunter Los Angeles und New York. Die Gesetzeslage variiert von Stadt zu Stadt, doch im Allgemeinen beschützt sie illegale Einwanderer, die gewaltlose Verbrechen begangen haben, davor, von den Lokalregierungen an die Bundesbehörden übergeben zu werden. Das Verüben von Kavaliersdelikten durch Migranten führt demnach nicht zwingend zu bundesstaatlichem Gewahrsam. Stadtmitarbeiter und Strafverfolgungsbehörden einer sogenannten Asyl-Stadt dürfen zudem nicht nach dem Einwanderungsstatus eines Strafverdächtigen fragen. Gegner der Verordnung argumentieren, dass diese kriminelle Zuwanderer vor der Abschiebung bewahre.',\n",

And so we\\'ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\\n\\nIn a sense we\\'ve come to our nation\\'s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"\\n\\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we\\'ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\\n\\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God\\'s children.\\n\\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro\\'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\\n\\nBut there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\\n\\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.\\n\\nWe cannot walk alone.\\n\\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.\\n\\nWe cannot turn back.\\n\\nThere are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. **We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro\\'s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\"** We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"1\\n\\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.\\n\\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.\\n\\nAnd so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\\n\\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"\\n\\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\\n\\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\\n\\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\\n\\nI have a dream today!\\n\\nI have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\\n\\nI have a dream today!\\n\\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\"2\\n\\nThis is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.\\n\\nWith this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\\n\\nAnd this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God\\'s children will be able to sing with new meaning:\\n\\nMy country \\'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim\\'s pride,    From every mountainside, let freedom ring!\\n\\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.\\n\\nAnd so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\\n\\nBut not only that:\\n\\nLet freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.\\n\\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.\\n\\nFrom every mountainside, let freedom ring\\n\\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\\'s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:\\n\\nFree at last! Free at last!\\n\\nThank God Almighty, we are free at last!3'"

       "'I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we\\'ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.In a sense we\\'ve come to our nation\\'s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we\\'ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God\\'s children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro\\'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.We cannot turn back.There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. **We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro\\'s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\"** We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"1I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\"2This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God\\'s children will be able to sing with new meaning:My country \\'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim\\'s pride,    From every mountainside, let freedom ring!And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.But not only that:Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.From every mountainside, let freedom ringAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\\'s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:Free at last! Free at last!Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!3'"

       "'I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we\\'ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.In a sense we\\'ve come to our nation\\'s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the \"unalienable Rights\" of \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we\\'ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God\\'s children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro\\'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.We cannot turn back.There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. **We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro\\'s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: \"For Whites Only.\"** We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"1I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification\" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; \"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\"2This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God\\'s children will be able to sing with new meaning:My country \\'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim\\'s pride,    From every mountainside, let freedom ring!And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.But not only that:Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.From every mountainside, let freedom ringAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\\'s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:Free at last! Free at last!Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!3'"
